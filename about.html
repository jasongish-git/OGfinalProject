        <div id="about-intro-text">
            <p>We've played games of all kinds, all of our lives: individual and team sports, board games, video games, mobile games, and most recently, games involving virtual reality. We believe games bring people of all ages together. They entertain and educate; encourage imagination, curiosity, and a sense of adventure; and they delight.</p>
    
            <p>Of course, they can also frustrate and annoy, and that’s why we’re here!</p> 
    
            <p>We can help you find, and learn how to play, games of all kinds.</p>

            <p>We love hearing your gaming stories, your ideas for new games, and stories about games that are "old favorites."</p>
