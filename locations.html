            Our next trip will be to Hokkaido in December of 2020. When it comes to rich culture and a winter experience, there is no place better to go than to the winter wonderland of Japan. We at Obscuratus pride our game concepts on originality and thick culture. Hokkaido may be far away, but we at Obscuratus will go beyond for our creations. We thank all of you for your support and excitment!

          <p class="loc-par">
            Obscuratus traveled to Africa in 2019 to do field research on the many different cultural pattern designs as well as animal behaviors. Africa's vibrant and captivating culture was made evident as we observed the native people of the land weave their intricate designs into cloth. These friendly and welcoming people, intimately familiar with the surrounding countryside, also showed us some of the best spots to observe animals in their natural habitat.

          <p class="loc-par">
            In 2018, Obscuratus went to China to capture the essence of Chinese beliefs for one of the possible games highlighting Chinese gang activity. During our stay, we experienced what it felt like to live in a very bustling but considerably restricted country. We went around talking to local police agencies and even found a resident willing to show us around their humble home. A game is made from the culture and time.

          <p class="loc-par">
           Traveling across Russia in 2017, Obscuratus learned more about what the sounds of music can mean. Music is one of many factors that can make or break a game and is what leads the mind of the player into the game's many worlds. We studied the instruments creating various sounds and matched these new sounds to contexts, environments, and emotions. Games are built on finely wrought details such as these!

            In 2021, Obscuratus will be traveling to Italy to research different types of food and spices that could be incorporated as assets in an upcoming game. We hope to find some of the local lore and even experience what it means to be part of the Italian culture. We plan to immerse ourselves in local heritage and culture - food, wine, spices, art, and architecture, looking for details to enrich our game environments and experiences. Your investment and donations support our work. Thank you for all of the support so far! We hope to keep creating the things that you all love and want more of.

             Obscuratus seeks support for our journey to Spain in 2022! We will be doing some aquatic research on oceanic life and the range of living forms beneath the water's surface, looking again for details to incorporate into our games. We are looking for recommendations for interpreters familiar with ocean biology and games. The trip will be paid for and you will get to accompany us on this journey in 2022! If you are interested don't forget to apply now!
