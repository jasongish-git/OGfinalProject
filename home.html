    <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
    <section id="our-story-grid-container">
        <div id="home-our-story"><p>It was an epic yard sale. Amy had quite the game collection, stored safely in her attic. People loved giving her board and card games for birthdays and holidays. Her neighbors, Cheyenne, Kyle and Jason, brought their own seldom-used games to add to the sale. Amy joked, "We should just open a store!" So we did. A few years later we've added our own game creations to our store stock. Donations from friends and family forced us to find larger locations and warehouse storage. Our stock is rising! Whether you're an investor, a collector, a gamer or someone looking to get rid of your dusty collection, we are looking forward to working with you.</p></div>
