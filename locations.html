            Obscuratus in travled to africa in 2019 to do field research on the many different cultural geometric and orgnic pattern designs as well as animal heahaviors. The culture was vibrent and captivating when watching the natives of the land weave such interakit designs into cloth. The natives not only knew the land but showed us some of the best spots to observe animals in their natural habitate.

          <p class="loc-par">
            In 2018 Obscuratus went to China to capture the essence of chinese beliefs for one of the possible games highlighting gangs in china. Durring our stay we experianced what it felt like to live in a very bustling and almost restricted country. We went around talking to local police agencies and even found a willing resident to show us around their humble home. A game is made from the culture and time.

          <p class="loc-par">
           In the year 2017 Obscuratus flew to Russia! Oh boy oh boy he we go again. Durring our time in Russia we went to all different parts of the counrty to find what the sound of music meant to us. Music is one factor thta will make or break a game. It is what leads the mind of the play into it's many worlds. We studied the instruments to the sound itself and what it was we were trying to express. Games are what you make them!
